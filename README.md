# DM__Project
In this project, we have tried to explain the working of path finding algorithms using easy examples/illustrations .These algorithms are based on Graph Theory which is a part of Discrete Mathematics.We also have tried to provide a software solution in the form of an android application which uses one of the algorithms in background.
